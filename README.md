Implementation of the paper:

[Scalable 3D Registration via Truncated Entry-wise Absolute Residuals] (CVPR 2024).

To apply this algorithm to your data, you may need to adjust the noise_bound and BRANCH_ACCURACY. For example, smaller BRANCH_ACCURACY leads to higher accuracy but requires more time cost.
